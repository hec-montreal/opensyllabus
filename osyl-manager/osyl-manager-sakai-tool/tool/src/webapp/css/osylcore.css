/*
   CSS definitions for OpenSyllabus (AKA Osyl)
   -------------------------------------------
   This file is (more or less) organized in sections as follows:
	  1. CSS definitions for reset and base attributes
      2. CSS definitions overriding default GWT styles and incubator widgets
      3. CSS definitions for new classes specific to Osyl
	  4. CSS definitions for read only view.
	  5. CSS definitions for print view.

   To be customized to your institution needs! All comments appreciated,
   we're no CSS experts!

   WARNING: at least two versions of this file exist in the project.

            The first one is located in the opensyllabus-gwt project and is only
            used by the GWT hosted mode. Its full path is:
            opensyllabus-gwt/src/org/sakaiquebec/opensyllabus/public/css/OsylCore.css

            The second one is located in the osyl project and is deployed in the
            web application, so this is the one everybody will see when using
            OpenSyllabus (with its default config). its full path is:
            opensyllabus-tool/tool/src/webapp/osylcoconfigs/default/skin/osylcore.css

	    At this time there is no difference between the two files, ie: when
	    you edit one of them, copy the file to its other location!
	    
	    Eventually we will remove the tool css and have our deployment script
	    copy it from the gwt folder to the webapp.
