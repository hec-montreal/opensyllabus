<h2>OpenSyllabus: Overview</h2>



<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>OpenSyllabus is a Model-based Syllabus Editor. Course Outlines or syllabi are universal gateways to effective 
teaching and learning in universities. 
OpenSyllabus allows easy syllabus creation, edition and navigation through a fast and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>The tasks of building and using an OSYL course outline are also greatly facilitated by the integration other Sakai tools. 
It therefore provides a centralized access to all online syllabus resources for both instructors and students.</p>




<h3>Key concepts</h3>

The OpenSyllabus project seeks to adapt to Sakai an easy-to-use tool to create and publish model-based syllabi  currently used 
at HEC Montr√©al with ZoneCours.
OpenSyllabus differs from the actual syllabus tool found in Sakai release 2.4 in three aspects:

 <p><strong>  For the instructor:</strong>unlike syllabus which offers no guidance to the instructor, 
 OpenSyllabus provides a template that organizes the material and resources usually found in a course outline in predefined sections 
 (introduction, contact information, learning material, assignments, weekly themes or lectures, etc.). 
 Instructors can upload their electronic resources (ppt, pdf, url, etc.) directly into the right syllabus section and qualify their use 
 (reading, exercise. general resource, etc.).
 </p> <p><strong>For the students:</strong> OpenSyllabus offers a unified interface with a standardized vocabulary for easy navigation 
 through the syllabus for all the course material.
  </p> <p><strong>For the administrative staff and the general public:</strong> OpenSyllabus offers a centralized location where all 
  the university syllabi can be found (current and archived ones). OpenSyllabus seamlessly presents public or private versions 
  of the syllabi (depending on the viewing rights) and merges information intended for all registered students of a course or for 
 the students attending a specific section. OpenSyllabus shares the openness objectives found in the MIT OpenCourseWare project.


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=ardn">Assessments via the Assignment tool integration</a> are part of a syllabus.<br /><br />
</li><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=avcd">Bibliographic references via the Citation helper</a> integration are also part of an OpenSyllabus course outline. 
Besides, a direct link to library resource allows an OpenSyllabus user to connect and access Library databases in order to build 
complete course material.
